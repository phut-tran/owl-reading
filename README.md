> E-reader for English learner.

ESL students often learn new vocabularies through reading. But they have to save
the wordlist in one place and import it to another tool for learning (recall it)
later. Isn't it pleased if there is a tool to help them both read and learn new
words in one place? Owl-Reading was born for that purpose.

## Features

- Add new, edit, remove, and read the document using a rich text editor.
- Lookup for new words, get translations for them.
- Recall saved words using the spaced-repetition technique.
